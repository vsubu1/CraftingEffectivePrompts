This repository contains the source codes for concepts explained in the book "Crafting Effective Prompts : A Practice to Prompt Engineering"
This book is available in Amazon in all market places in multiple formats.

Introduction about the book:

Prompt engineering is indeed an art, important for you effectively communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs) to get the results you want in a certain topic or context without any ambiguity

Prompt engineering is a method where we give clear instructions or questions or we will input text, which are called prompts, to guide models like GPT-4 creating specific results and display them as output. AI models have undergone extensive training on vast datasets, leading to the release of numerous models catering to various industries.

In this book, you will gain understanding on OpenAI, LLM, LLAMA2, LangChain, Transformer Model, Vector Store , HuggingFace and how to utilize them through the principles of Prompt Engineering using Prompt design techniques by solved programming examples written in Python.

Upon completion of this reading, you will have gained hands on experience in Prompt engineering principles, empowering you to apply them effectively to develop new applications specific to your interest and requirements.

Happy Learning!
